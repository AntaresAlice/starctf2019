The game is divided into two parts: defeating BOSS, walking through the password gate

The BOSS part must kill a BOSS with a high blood volume, attack, and defense, which cannot be achieved by just leveling-up.

There are several ways

Method 1: Use the modifier to change the two skills of dizzy and poison, change HP\MP, poison the BOSS, and then dizzy 10 rounds to defeat BOSS successfully.

Method 2: Skip BOSS directly with the map editor

Method 3: Use CE to modify the protagonist HP\MP and money, buy the best weapons to beat BOSS, theoretically feasible, but I havenâ€™t passed with this method, curious to know how some teams use this method to pass. . .
